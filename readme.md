20+ Native Solana Programs (Beginner to God-Level)

## Description

A complete end-to-end Solana blockchain engineering journey - from absolute basics to protocol-level, production-grade programs. This repo contains 20+ native Rust Solana smart contracts, written without Anchor to understand the chain under the hood.

View the complete [Learning Path and Project Breakdown](projects.md).

## Project Concepts

Each project is built to strengthen a specific set of Solana concepts:

- Accounts, PDA, system program
- SPL token CPI, vaults, escrow
- Multisig, staking, vesting
- AMMs, orderbooks, liquid staking
- Flash loans, lending markets
- Perpetual futures (Drift-style)
- MEV bundling (Jito-style)
- Rollup settlement
- Runtime-inside-a-runtime (final boss)

## Repository Structure

This repository is structured as a hybrid monorepo - each program lives in its own folder, isolated, testable, deployable, and fully documented, while still living under a single roof for visibility and growth.

## Perfect For

- Developers mastering Solana internals
- Rust engineers learning blockchain high-performance systems
- Open-source contributors
- Hiring showcase for protocol teams

Roadmap, requirements, docs, and tests included for every project.
